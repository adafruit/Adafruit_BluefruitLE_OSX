# Adafruit Bluefruit Buddy OS X

[Bluefruit Buddy](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bluefruit-buddy/id1042412646?mt=12) is available in the iTunes Store, and provides basic connectivity on OS X for the Adafruit Bluefruit LE family of devices.  This app is currently a proof of concept and does not expose the same functionality as the iOS or Android applications, but should be a useful starting point to work with Bluefruit devices on any recent Macbook or iMac.

This repository contains the source code for the app above, which is based on the native CoreBluetooth API.
